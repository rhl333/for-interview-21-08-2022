## i am adding environment files on the github, only for this interview purpose. They told me that we will run your code in our machine. although i could have provided an enviornment templet file but i want to make it very easy.

# ENVIRONMENT FILES NEVER EVER SHOULD BE UPLOADED TO ANY PUBLIC REPOSITERY.

### I have used React as front end and Node and mongodb as backend.

### I am running this project in my local computer and it working perfectly fine.

### If you get any error during runtime then please let me know.

# I would suggest you to clear out your borwser's localstorage for localhost:3000, before running it.
